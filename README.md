# BostonWalk
Navigating through the data of Boston's residents
### Details
I populated an html file making use of public data (data.js) displaying only parts of the data (name and respective salary). I had to reorder the object with sort() to first display the top five earners. Next, I reordered the data to only display those people making $200,000 or above using filter(). I had to pass functions to set the criteria.
### Potential Improvements
The data could be filtered though in a number of different ways in the future including finding the median and outputting it in a more user-friendly, stylized way.
### How to Run
